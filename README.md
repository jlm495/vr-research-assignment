### Title
Filling a cup

## Interaction Description
The interaction I'm going to explore is filling a cup with water. The 3 implementations I want to do are:
- using a spicket (via trigger & drag, release)
- using a bigger cup (via button & drag, hold)
- using your hands that spew water (via both triggers at the same time & trying to aim)

### XR Experiment Deliverable
The objective of these interactions is to fill a bucket with water. 

## Interactions
The three interactions are:
- pushing a button (physical space)
- shooting water out of the player's hands (triggers & aim)
- grabbing a smaller bucket and pouring (left paddle & tilt)

## Observations

From my research interviews, a clear preference emerged for physical, hands-on interactions rather than pressing buttons or using triggers. Users consistently favored shooting water from their hands or pouring the smaller bucket into the big one, both of which require more movement around the space, as well as technique. The current button interaction, particularly how low I placed it, seemed awkward and unengaging for most participants. Some expressed that it didn’t make as much sense as the other two, and others claimed it felt less interactive.

Additionally, testers expressed strong interest in a scooping mechanic to replace the current button-activated waterfall. The desire for more direct physical manipulation also tells me that using spheres to simulate water might feel more natural to handle and be more realistic (regarding the physics) than the particle system that I’m currently using. I also received feedback that incorporating a rising water line in the bucket would be more engaging and add more polish.
