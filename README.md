### Title
Filling a cup

## Interaction Description
The interaction I'm going to explore is filling a cup with water. The 3 implementations I want to do are:
- using a spicket (via trigger & drag, release)
- using a bigger cup (via button & drag, hold)
- using your hands that spew water (via both triggers at the same time & trying to aim)

### XR Experiment Deliverable
The objective of these interactions is to fill a bucket with water. 

## Interactions
The three interactions are:
- pushing a button (physical space)
- shooting water out of the player's hands (triggers & aim)
- grabbing a smaller bucket and pouring (left paddle & tilt)
