# Interaction Research - Intro to VR
Filling a cup
Jenna Mandel

## Interaction Description
The interaction I'm going to explore is filling a cup with water. The 3 implementations I want to do are:
- using a spicket (via trigger & drag, release)
- using a bigger cup (via button & drag, hold)
- using your hands that spew water (via both triggers at the same time & trying to aim)
